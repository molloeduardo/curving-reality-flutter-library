# What is this for?

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height: 2rem;">
A Flutter library that speeds up development with ready-to-use UI components, screens, and services to build high-quality iOS and Android apps from a single codebase.
</p>

The **Curving Reality Flutter Library** is designed to accelerate your app development workflow.<br>
It provides a rich collection of efficient and visually appealing **UI components**, **ready-to-use screens**, and practical **services**, including powerful tools for **forms validation**.<br>
<br>
Its core mission is to **reduce boilerplate code and simplify common development tasks**, allowing you to deliver **high-quality applications more quickly**.<br>
While focusing on productivity, the library also emphasizes **design consistency** and **user experience**, helping you create apps that are not only functional but also beautifully crafted.

<br>

# Example: before and after

A multiplatform button created without and with the library.

<div class="flex-center">
    <div class="laptop-container">
        <iframe src="https://www.eduardomollo.com/projects/flutter-library/before-after.html" style="height: 1000px; border: solid 6px #111; border-radius: 36px; box-shadow: 0px 15px 15px #b0b0b0"></iframe>
    </div>

# Interactive sample

Navigate this interactive example with all the components.<br>
Keep in mind that this is the representation of the Android UI. The style and the animations will be different when running on iOS.
